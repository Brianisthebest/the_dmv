# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

Reflections

1. I read the error message, used it to find which test was failing and went from there. Looking for simple spelling mistakes or a missing , before then looking to see if the code itself was written incorrectly. That find needing to be a find_all took me a minute.
2. It was different, but it was almost written similarly enought to what I've been trying out so I felt like I could work my way through it. I've trying to help others in the SH and working with them to tell me about their code and what they think it's doing has helped me learn how others manipulate their code in different ways which was very helpful.
3. I was expecting their to be a lot more errors and was anticpating more fixes needed. Find and it needing to be find_all probably took me the longest, and I've been working through enumerables practice work recently to get better with them so I'll keep doing that.
